customJSS
=========

DISCLAIMER: This script is provided as-is... enjoy. As you might be able to tell by the code I am not a JS pro in any sense.

Customizes the JAMF JSS web front-end with goal of improving interface appearance and usability.

Meant for use with Tampermonkey and Chrome. 

To use, install Tampermonkey and paste the JS file in as a script. There's a better way to do it, haven't checked that out yet. Sorry

Known bugs:

- Expandable/shrinkable sidebar is sliver-thin when minimized
- User gear/preferences menu appears underneath top bar
- Initial JSS dashboard messages are too far up
- You tell me!
